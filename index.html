            <p><em><strong>Atmosphere</strong></em> is a layer of gases surrounding a planet or other celestial body, held in place by gravity.
                 On Earth, the atmosphere is vital for life as it provides the air we breathe, protects us from harmful solar radiation, and helps regulate the planet's temperature. Here is a detailed breakdown of the Earth's atmosphere:</p>
                 Here is a detailed breakdown of the Earth's atmosphere:
                 

                 <p>Composition of the Atmosphere
                    The Earth's atmosphere is composed of several gases, with the primary components being:
                    
                    <strong>Nitrogen</strong> (N2): About 78%
                    <strong>Oxygen</strong> (O2): About 21%
                    <strong>Argon</strong> (Ar): About 0.93%
                    <strong>Carbon Dioxide</strong> (CO2): About 0.04%
                    Trace gases: Including neon, helium, methane, krypton, hydrogen, and xenon
                    Water vapor: Varies, but can be up to 4% in tropical regions</p>
    
                    <p>The presence of water vapor varies widely, contributing to weather patterns and climatic conditions.
                         Beyond its chemical composition, the atmosphere serves as a protective shield, safeguarding life from the sun's harmful ultraviolet radiation through the ozone layer and moderating the planet's temperature by trapping heat via the greenhouse effect.</p>
    
                
                <p>Structurally, the atmosphere is divided into distinct layers, each characterized by unique properties and functions.</p>

                            <p> <u><strong><h6>Note:</h6></strong></u> Planetary Atmospheres: Beyond Earth, scientists also study the atmospheres of other planets and celestial bodies. For example:<br>
                                <strong>Mars</strong>: Mars has a thin atmosphere primarily composed of carbon dioxide. Researchers study its behavior, seasonal variations, and potential for supporting life.<br>
                                <strong>Venus</strong> Venus has a thick, acidic atmosphere with extreme temperatures. Scientists investigate its greenhouse effect and atmospheric chemistry.<br>
                                <strong>Titan (Saturn’s Moon)</strong>: Titan’s atmosphere contains nitrogen and methane. Researchers explore its unique properties and potential for prebiotic chemistry.</p>
                            
                                <p>The atmosphere plays a crucial role in maintaining Earth's climate and weather systems. It acts as a medium for the water cycle, driving precipitation and evaporation, and it distributes heat around the planet, balancing temperature extremes.
                                 Atmospheric pressure, which decreases with altitude, affects weather patterns and is a key factor in the movement of air masses. The atmosphere also supports respiration for living organisms and provides carbon dioxide for photosynthesis, which is essential for plant life and the production of oxygen.
                                 Additionally, the atmospheric composition and its dynamics influence various ecological and geological processes, making it integral to the planet's overall functioning.</p>
                
                            <p>Human activities have increasingly impacted the atmosphere, leading to significant environmental challenges. The burning of fossil fuels has elevated levels of carbon dioxide, enhancing the greenhouse effect and contributing to global warming. 
                                Air pollution from industrial emissions, vehicle exhaust, and other sources introduces harmful substances into the atmosphere, affecting air quality and health. Moreover, the release of chlorofluorocarbons and other chemicals has led to the depletion of the ozone layer, increasing the risk of ultraviolet radiation exposure.
                                 These changes underscore the need for sustainable practices and policies to protect and preserve the atmosphere for future generations.</p>
