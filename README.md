<h1>Informative Website on the Atmosphere:</h1>
To improve my web development skills, I created an informative, responsive website about the atmosphere. The site includes details about the different layers of the atmosphere, along with various interactive and engaging elements, including a commenting system powered by Disqus for user interaction.<br>

<h3>Features</h3>
<strong>Educational Content:</strong> Detailed information about the atmosphere and its layers.<br>
<strong>Responsive Design</strong>: The website is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a great user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.<br>
<strong>Multimedia Integration:</strong> Includes relevant photos, an embedded YouTube video, and links for further reading.<br>
<strong>Interactive Quiz:</strong> A quiz to test users' knowledge about the atmosphere.<br>
<strong>Commenting System:</strong> Integrated with Disqus, allowing users to share their thoughts and ask questions.<br>

<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
<strong>HTML:</strong> For structuring the website content.<br>
<strong>CSS:</strong> For styling the website and making it responsive.<br>
<strong>JavaScript:</strong> For interactive elements and the quiz functionality.<br>
<strong>Disqus:</strong> For the commenting system to facilitate user interaction.<br>
